</p>

Automatic and intelligent error detection and process monitoring for your OctoPrint-enabled 3D printer, with full remote control, management and access from anywhere. Additionally, receive notifications and updates via your chosen communication medium, alerting you of failures and keeping you updated on the state of the 3D print. Overview your print history and gain insights into filament use, print times and your printer reliability.

### Error detection and process monitoring

3D printers are not the most reliable of machines. All of us have suffered from errors whilst printing and many users find themselves _handcuffed_ to their printers, having to constantly check the printer every 5 minutes to make sure that the print is _still_ okay! If this sounds familiar to you... hopefully this plugin will help.

Numerous computer vision techniques are used to determine if an error has occurred during your 3D print. Using a mixture of machine learning, 3D printing heuristics and the direct comparison of g-code to the current state of the 3D print, an errors are reliably determined in an image of the print.

Errors that are currently detected reliably:

- Detatchment from print bed
- Offset
- Warping
- Poor bed adhesion
- Spaghetti
- Blocked extruder / out of filament
- Hotend too close to print bed

### Remote control and management

Access your 3D printer from anywhere in the world (provided that there is an internet connection...) via the OctoPrint-Mattacloud Plugin.

At present, the plugin enables you to do the following:

- View and update hotend, bed and chamber temperatures
- Control and home X, Y and Z axes
- Select prints to retrieve information
- Start, cancel, pause, resume and restart 3D prints
- Upload g-code files remotely to your printer for printing
- Delete g-code files remotely
- Receive the latest images/snapshots from your printer
- See your prints progress (time remaining and percentage completion)

### Notifications and updates

    <br/>
</p>

By installing this plugin and linking a printer to your **mattacloud** account, you can receive useful notifications and updates concerning your 3D printer via various channels. When an error occurs during the 3D printing process, you will receive an alert with an attached image showing the error in addition to current progress, material usage and other useful statistics; you can then deside to take action. Additionally, you can also set up other checkpoints to receive notifications, such as upon object completion, or when a print has reached the half way mark. 

The communication channels which are currently supported are:

- Email
- SMS (Beta)
- WhatsApp (Beta)
- Facebook Messenger (Beta)
